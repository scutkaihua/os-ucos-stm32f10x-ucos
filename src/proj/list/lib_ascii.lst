N* Note(s)       : (1) NO compiler-supplied standard library functions are used in library or product software.
N*
N*                     (a) ALL standard library functions are implemented in the custom library modules :
N*
N*                         (1) \<Custom Library Directory>\lib_*.*
N*
N*                         (2) \<Custom Library Directory>\Ports\<cpu>\<compiler>\lib*_a.*
N*
N*                               where
N*                                       <Custom Library Directory>      directory path for custom library software
N*                                       <cpu>                           directory name for specific processor (CPU)
N*                                       <compiler>                      directory name for specific compiler
N*
N*                     (b) Product-specific library functions are implemented in individual products.
N*
N*
N*                 (2) (a) ECMA-6 '7-Bit coded Character Set' (6th edition), which corresponds to the
N*                         3rd edition of ISO 646, specifies several versions of a 7-bit character set :
N*
N*                         (1) THE GENERAL VERSION, which allows characters at 0x23 and 0x24 to be given a
N*                             set alternate form and allows the characters 0x40, 0x5B, 0x5D, 0x60, 0x7B &
N*                             0x7D to be assigned a "unique graphic character" or to be declared as unused.
N*                             All other characters are explicitly specified.
N*
N*                         (2) THE INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE VERSION, which explicitly specifies all characters
N*                             in the 7-bit character set.
N*
N*                         (3) NATIONAL & APPLICATION-ORIENTED VERSIONS, which may be derived from the
N*                             standard in specified ways.
N*
N*                     (b) The character set represented in this file reproduces the Internation Reference
N*                         Version.  This is identical to the 7-bit character set which occupies Unicode
N*                         characters 0x0000 through 0x007F.  The character names are taken from v5.0 of the
N*                         Unicode specification, with certain abbreviations so that the resulting #define
N*                         names will not violate ANSI C naming restriction :
N*
N*                         (1) For the Latin capital & lowercase letters, the name components 'LETTER_CAPITAL'
N*                             & 'LETTER_SMALL' are replaced by 'UPPER' & 'LOWER', respectively.
